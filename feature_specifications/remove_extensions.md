For context, see drive_to_class_json.py lines 547-548.
i want two different implementations, and if True, do the first implementation: 
1. add a function that removes all file extensions.
2. Add additional file extensions to be removed. add a list called REMOVED_EXTENSIONS, that the user will choose which file extensions he wishes to remove, for example, pdf, mp4, etc.
